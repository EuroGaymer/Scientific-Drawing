This a very simple program which might provide you with a template if you prefer Python to Origin for scientific visualization, specifically in the general field of Chemistry and Materials Science and Engineering.

The program has two major parts. The first one, 'FileReader', reads and process raw data from your experiment equipment. (Of course you have to modify it or create new functions for your specific data form).

The second part, 'academic_graph', visualizes the data. Despite the many options the Pyplot provides, what motivated me most to write this module is to save the laborious work when you have process and draw multiple datapoints or lines manually using Origin. You should also adapt this part to your own need.

To use this program, simply paste the two modules to the Python libraries directory for a machine-wide accessability (in my case 'C:\ANACONDA\Lib\site-packages') or another place you want.
